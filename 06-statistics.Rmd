# HW1: Organization

Organizational:

1. Try to write answers to `lesson0x.R`, this will make life for us easier.

2. Try not to have duplicates of your files.


---

# HW1: R Usage I

1. Some confusion on the pipe `%>%` does.

2. Common problem was to solve the bonus exercise of `lesson02.R` (reading the data that uses `"null"` for missing values).

    library(readr)
    data3 <- read_csv("data/example3.csv", na = "null")
    data3

3. `/scripts/prepare.R` vs `/reports/final.Rmd`. Where does a plot belong to?


---


# HW1: R Usage II

4. **Never, ever, ever use relative paths to your computer**. Always refer to the root of your project!

5. Order of geoms in ggplot dictates which one will be drawn on top.

6. Don't leave `install.packages(...)` in your code. Comment out!
