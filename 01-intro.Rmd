# Goal: Reproducible Report

- At the end of the course, you will be able to write a reproducible research report in R.

- Such a report covers the full data science workflow: all steps from data preparation, transformation, visualization modeling up to the final report.

- We would like to cover the whole workflow from data to communication as quickly as possible.

# Group research project


---
# Group research project

- Students must submit a reproducible research report for course completion.

- The research project is written in groups of 2‐3 students.

- Written in RMarkdown, and includes blocks of data transformation, modeling and visualization.

- Collaboration is done on GitHub, a version control platform, which is ideal for collaboratively developing code and research reports.

---
# Contributes 70% to the final grade

  - R skills (40%)

  - Originality (10%)

  - Scientific and presentational style (20%)

  - The same grade is given to all members of the group.

---

# Group presentations

- The report must be presented in class (5 min presentation / 5 min discussion per group).

- We want to start at week 5.

- Completion of the report is not needed at the time of presentation.

- As an early presenter, you present your topic, the current status of your work and some interesting challenges you face. The challenges may be R related, so it is interesting for other groups to learn about them.

---
# Group report

- 7 to 12 pages

- Must be written in RMarkdown

- Collaboration and submission is done via GitHub


---
# Topics

- Any project of your interest

- Serious, fun, personal or general questions

- Should cover the whole data science workflow

  - getting, cleaning, transforming data

  - visualization

  - modeling

  - reporting

---
# Some ideas

- Scrape construction company websites to gain insights on real estate market

- Use Google trend data for product analysis

- Weather analysis at your favorite holiday location

---
# Group building

- Groups of 2‐3

- Group building via Canvas

# Individual assignments



---
# Individual assignments

- Each lesson, we will solve some excercises that can be completed at home.

- The excercises of multiple lessons belong to an assignement set.

- There are 3 assignment sets

- Hand-in via GitHub

---
# Due dates

- One week after end of a part

- Assignment 1 (covers part 1):  17.10

- Assignment 2 (covers part 2):  21.11

- Assignment 3 (covers part 3):  12.12.

# Infrastructure


---
# Local RStudio instance

- It's best to have R and R Studio installed on you own laptop.

- Help-desk after class

- It should work until the next lesson.

- If you have troubles installing it, contact us.


---
# GitHub

- We collaborate throught GitHub at: https://github.com/unisg-progr-19

- Send an email to some students

- Also install GitHub desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

# {ggplot2}: Basic pattern

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = ..., ...)) +
  geom_...(...)
```
---

# {ggplot2}: Example

```{r fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```
---

# {ggplot2}: Layers and facets

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(...)) +
  geom_...(aes(...), ...) +
  geom_...(aes(...), ...) +
  ... +
  facet_...(...)
```
